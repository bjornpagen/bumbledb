# Schema — theories, instances, ground facts (Level 0, PRD 03)

The substrate the dependency judgments quantify over: headers
(relation signatures), facts, projections over field sets,
disjunctive selections, statements (the four declared forms and
nothing else), theories, instances, and the ground axioms of closed
relations as instance-independent sealed constants.

## The acceptance boundary is part of the model

* **Selections are membership-to-literal-set BY REPRESENTATION
  (E3, disjunctive selections).** `Selection` is a finite list of
  (field, literal-set) bindings read conjunctively, each binding a
  disjunction over its spelled set — no richer predicate is writable
  at this level. The ENGINE's accepted σ fragment is this same
  representation: `Side.selection` carries (field, literal-set)
  bindings (`LiteralSet` in `crates/bumbledb/src/schema.rs`; the
  macro's `parse_side` parses `f == L` and `f == {A, B}`). A
  singleton set is exactly the equality binding
  (`Selection.singleton_satisfies_iff`) and stays the engine's
  zero-cost `One` arm, so the wider representation re-reads every
  previously accepted σ unchanged; the sets are first-class rather
  than per-literal sugar because counts over a union do not decompose
  (`Countermodels.disjunctive_window_not_literal_conjunction`). The
  decidability-firewall tripwire's recorded edge
  (`docs/architecture/30-dependencies.md` § the decidability
  firewall) is the same decision docs-side, executed 2026-07-14.
* **Statements are the three judgment forms**: functionality and
  containment exactly as `StatementDescriptor`, plus the cardinality
  window extension form with its denotation in `Cardinality.lean`.
  No constraint kinds, no modes, no triggers.
* **Ground axioms are constants of the THEORY.** A closed relation's
  extension is sealed at declaration and `Instance`-independent by
  type (`Theory.den` never consults the instance for it) —
  `den_closed_constant` is the one-line theorem.

## Narrowings recorded (law 5: narrow and record)

* **Discharged (2026-07-14): the literal-SET σ form.** The engine's
  accepted σ fragment is the (field, literal-set) disjunctive form —
  `Side.selection` is `Box<[(FieldId, LiteralSet)]>`
  (`crates/bumbledb/src/schema.rs`), the sealed `CompiledCheck`
  set arms judge membership among the sealed encodings, and the
  canonical form is sorted and duplicate-free (validation rejects
  the degenerate spellings). The singleton `One` arm is
  byte-identical to the pre-set engine —
  `Selection.singleton_satisfies_iff` is that agreement, and the
  `Bridge.lean` row for the set form cites it.
* **A fact is a total field-indexed value assignment**
  (`Fact := FieldId → Value`). Arity and positional typing are the
  header's concern, and no PRD 03 theorem needs a typing premise —
  the judgments quantify over whatever fact sets an instance carries.
  Fields beyond a relation's arity are junk the judgments never read
  except through fact identity; instances of interest carry
  arity-respecting facts.
* **Finiteness is a named token, never ambient.** `Set.Finite` is the
  listability token; none of PRD 03's theorems demand it (they are
  subset and injectivity algebra, finite or not), so it is defined and
  deliberately unspent here. `den_closed_finite` shows the sealed
  extension carries it by construction.
* **`Point` is the tagged sum of the two interval element domains.**
  Every pointwise judgment quantifies over `Set Point`, which makes
  the judgments total without a typing premise: a scalar value denotes
  no points, and positional structural typing keeps accepted
  statements within one tag.
* **`Header.intervalSplit` reads the field SET, never the written
  order** — the FieldSet doctrine: `resolve_target_key` counts
  interval positions as a set and `key_permutation` bridges statement
  order to key order, so the engine's pointwise reading is
  order-canonical and the split matches it. Exactly one interval-typed
  field splits to the pointwise shape at ANY written position; zero or
  several split to `none` and receive the scalar reading downstream.
  The several-interval shape is gate-refused
  (`FunctionalityMultipleIntervals`; the pointwise gate in
  `resolve_target_key`); `holds` is consumed on accepted theories
  only.
* Acceptance's remaining shape checks (duplicate-free projections,
  arity and positional type match between sides, determinant width,
  the FD-side interval-finality demand — the neighbor probe's
  mechanism, not semantics — and the σ shape refusals
  `SelectedFieldProjected` and `DuplicateSelectionField`,
  `validate.rs:645-651`, `:666-671`, which narrow the accepted σ
  fragment below `Selection`'s representable shapes, sound direction)
  are validator mechanism this level does not restate — only the
  exact-field-set target-key rule is modeled (`Dependencies.lean`),
  because it is the piece the theorems spend.

it fieldwise to the encoding. -/

/-- σ — the spec's selection fragment: a finite list of
(field, literal-SET) bindings, read conjunctively; each binding is
the DISJUNCTION over its spelled set (the field's value is a MEMBER).
Membership-to-literal-set BY REPRESENTATION: no richer predicate is
writable. The engine's accepted σ is this same fragment
(`LiteralSet` in `crates/bumbledb/src/schema.rs`;
`validate_side_selection` and the sealed `CompiledCheck` arms consume
it), and `Selection.singleton_satisfies_iff` proves the singleton
reading is exactly the equality binding — the engine's zero-cost
`One` arm, unchanged in meaning. The sets are
first-class, not sugar: a window over a disjunctive selection is not
any conjunction of per-literal windows
(`Countermodels.disjunctive_window_not_literal_conjunction`). -/

among `φ'`'s, then `φ'` implies `φ` — the accepted fragment's only
syntactic strengthening move, spent by `selection_monotonicity`.

`selection_monotonicity`'s semantic hypotheses carry it already.) -/

  | i64 (x : I64)

/-- The point-family a VALUE denotes: an interval value denotes its
half-open `Interval.points` (tagged); every scalar value denotes no

interval positions through exactly this set — "a fact stands for its
point-family". -/

/-- An interval-typed value denotes a NONEMPTY point family —
`interval_nonempty` read through the fact-level denotation. This is
how consumers discharge a "some point exists" premise on
arity-respecting instances (`keyprobe_pointwise_key_spent`'s typing
hypothesis): a stored interval column carries interval values, and
every representable interval is inhabited. -/

type AND the fixed-width family: `interval<E, w>` is interval-shaped
to every consumer of this discriminator, which is why `intervalSplit`
and BOTH pointwise judgments engage for fixed-width positions with
ZERO changes to any dependency judgment (they quantify over
`Value.points` and this split alone — the design's beauty; verified
against `Dependencies.lean` and `Admission.lean`, 2026-07-15). -/

/-- The set-canonical interval shape of a determinant or projection —
the FieldSet doctrine (`schema/validate.rs::resolve_target_key` counts
interval positions as a SET; `key_permutation` bridges written order
to key order): a projection whose field set carries EXACTLY ONE
interval-typed field splits to `some` — the scalar rest in written
order, paired with that interval field, wherever it was written.
Every other shape splits to `none`, truthfully: zero interval fields
is the classical reading, and two or more are gate-refused
(`FunctionalityMultipleIntervals`; the pointwise gate in
`resolve_target_key`) and take the scalar-reading default recorded in
the module doc. -/

/-! ## Extension syntax — windows

The statement form the dependency-vocabulary extension adds carries
syntax of its own: the count window of `A(X | φ) in n..m per
B(Y | ψ)`. Syntax only — the denotation lives in
`Cardinality.lean`. -/

/-- A cardinality window `n..m`. `hi = none` is the `*` spelling —
the ONLY spelling of "no upper bound", and the DEFAULT posture: the
`0..*` window is provably vacuous and universal (`zero_star_admits`,
`star_subsumes` in `Cardinality.lean`), so a spelled statement is
always a strengthening of the default, never a repair of it. -/
structure Window where
  /-- The inclusive lower count bound. -/
  lo : Nat
  /-- The inclusive upper count bound; `none` is `*`. -/

/-! ## Statements — the declared forms -/

Dependencies and queries share one representation — a dependency is a
required property of an ordinary query, not a new kind of thing. -/
structure Atom where
  relation : RelId
  projection : List FieldId
  selection : Selection

/-- A declared dependency statement — the two original judgment forms
(`crate::schema::StatementDescriptor`) plus the cardinality-window
extension form, judged in the STATEMENT phase like every other
statement. `==` is not a form: the macro lowers it to two adjacent
containments, each judged independently. Readings live in
`Statement.judgment`. -/
inductive Statement where
  /-- `R(X) -> R`: functionality, key form only (the acceptance
  gate refuses non-key and selected FDs — they are relation splits
  waiting to happen). -/
  | functionality (relation : RelId) (projection : List FieldId)
  /-- `A(X | φ) <= B(Y | ψ)`: containment. -/
  | containment (source target : Atom)
  /-- `A(X | φ) in n..m per B(Y | ψ)`: the cardinality window —
  per selected target fact, the count of selected source facts
  sharing its projected tuple lies in the window
  (`CardinalityWindow`, `Cardinality.lean`). Acceptance gate as for
  `<=`: `Y` must be a key of `B` — an ACCEPTANCE premise, never a
  conjunct of the denotation. -/
  | cardinality (source : Atom) (window : Window) (target : Atom)

/-! ## Theories, instances, ground axioms -/

/-- A closed relation's sealed extension: the ground axioms, a finite
fact list fixed at declaration (`crate::schema::SealedRow`; the ≤256
roster cap is mechanism, not modeled). -/
