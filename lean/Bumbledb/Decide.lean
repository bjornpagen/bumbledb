# Decide — the finite-instance judgment, decided (Level 1)

`holds T I` is Level 0's final-state judgment over arbitrary fact
sets; on finite, row-listed instances it is DECIDABLE, and this
module is that fact made executable: one Boolean checker per
statement form, each proved sound AND complete against its
`Statement.judgment` denotation (`funcB_iff`, `pointwiseKeyB_iff`,
`containB_iff`, `coverageB_iff`, `cardinalityB_iff`,
`orderMarkB_iff`, `rankedB_iff`), composed into the per-statement
dispatcher (`Statement.checkB`, `Statement.checkB_iff`), the
whole-theory executable judge (`holdsB`, `holdsB_iff_holds`, the
derived `decideJudgment`/`decideHolds`), and the two-phase
`Txn.judgeB` — key phase then statement phase, mirroring `Txn.judge`
and proved to agree with its verdict and its violation sets, phase
for phase, with NO instance-side premise beyond the merge: under the
hop-key rule's acceptance form (`RankKeysDeclared`, a fact of the
theory alone) the agreement covers every row instance, hop-key
violators included (`Txn.judgeB_agrees_of_declared`; the key phase
is chain-premise-free, `Txn.mem_keyViolationsB`, and a clean key
phase derives the semantic premise, `rankKeysHold_of_clean_keys`,
that the conditioned form `Txn.judgeB_agrees` spends together with
`Txn.mem_statementViolationsB`).

Placement recorded: the file sits at the tree root beside `Txn.lean`
because its subject is the WRITE-side judgment — statements,
theories, the commit judge — Level-1 work by the refinement chain (an
executable form proved equal to its denotation), but not a query
stage, so it does not live under `Exec/`.

## The carrier — rows, because fact identity must be decided

The finite carrier is `RowInstance`: per-relation fact lists whose
facts are given as VALUE ROWS — the conformance lane's interchange
shape (`Conformance.decodeFact` reads exactly this row form), denoted
through the machinery that already exists: `Query.tupleFact` (the
executable evaluator's tuple-fact reading, `Exec/Fixpoint.lean`) and
`Query.ListInstance` (the eval machinery's association-list world,
`Query/Denotation.lean`) — `RowInstance.world` / `RowInstance.den`
reuse both, never duplicate them. Rows rather than bare `Fact`
functions is forced, not stylistic: `Fact` is `FieldId → Value` with
no decidable equality, and the key and order judgments CONCLUDE fact
equality — a row's finite support is what makes tuple-fact equality
decidable (`rowEqB_iff`: agreement on the shared index range, filler
beyond it). Recorded narrowing: the checkers judge instances whose
facts are row-denoted — exactly the conformance corpus's world shape.

## The premises — acceptance enters as hypotheses (the tree's rule)

* **`WorldCarriesClosed`** — the world carries each sealed ground
  roster at its relation (the conformance lane's merge:
  `Conformance.decodeCase` appends the ground axioms into the world).
  Under it, `Theory.den` reads every relation through the row lists
  (`theoryDen_denotes`). A sealed `GroundExtension` is a `Fact` list,
  not a row list, so its members' equality is not decidable in place;
  the merge premise is the honest boundary, and it is what the lane
  already does.
* **`RankKeysHold`** — every declared `by` chain's hop relation is
  keyed on the hop's key field, semantically, on the judged instance:
  the ranked checker reads ranks through the deterministic list probe
  (`chainEvalL`), and `chain_eval_deterministic`
  (`Subsumption.lean`) is what licenses that function reading of the
  relational `chainEval` — `chainEvalL_complete` spends it hop by
  hop. This is the ranked form's acceptance rule spent semantically,
  carried as a hypothesis wherever a theorem needs it, never a
  conjunct of any denotation — `Dependencies.lean`'s discipline,
  unchanged. The premise fails on exactly the instances that violate
  a declared rank-hop key, so nothing conditioned on it says
  anything there — which is why the TWO-PHASE agreement does not
  stop at it: `RankKeysDeclared` is the same rule in acceptance form
  (the hop key is a DECLARED scalar functionality statement), an
  instance-free premise under which the agreement is total — a
  hop-key violator convicts in the chain-premise-free key phase on
  both sides, and a clean key phase derives `RankKeysHold`
  (`rankKeysHold_of_clean_keys`).

## The sweep is spent where union coverage demands it

`coverageB` runs the PROVED sweep: `Exec.sweepCovered` over
`sortByStart` — soundness premise-free (`sweep_never_false_accepts`),
completeness from the sort's start order
(`sweep_complete_of_ordered` + `pairwise_sortByStart`) — because
per-point coverage by a UNION of target segments is not a pairwise
fact. The pointwise KEY checker is pairwise value-level disjointness
(`pointsDisjointB_iff`, two boundary comparisons per element domain)
— the shape of `pointwise_key_disjoint`; the engine's sorted
neighbor probe (`Applier::probe_neighbors`) is mechanism below this
altitude, recorded in the Bridge rows that already exist.

## Third oracle, write side — Undischarged (spec-ahead)

The conformance lane's third oracle executes the QUERY denotation
today (`Conformance.lean`; `lake exe conformance` in the gate). This
module extends the prepared surface to the WRITE side: `holdsB` and
`Txn.judgeB` are the executable JUDGMENT arm — engine verdict vs
naive verdict vs this judge — whose prepared consumer is the
judgment-case corpus, landing with the Rust swoop. Undischarged
(spec-ahead): no conformance case exercises these checkers yet, no
`Bridge.lean` row cites this module (deliberate — the ledger carries
only what exists), and nothing here claims the lane runs a judgment
arm today.

## Narrowings recorded (law 5: narrow and record)

* The row carrier and the two premises — above.
* `Txn.judgeB` returns `Option (List Statement)`: `none` accepts; a
  rejection's LIST may repeat a statement the theory declares twice.
  Agreement with `Txn.judge` is stated as membership equality with
  the violation SETS — `Txn.lean`'s own recorded narrowing (a set
  carries no duplicates or order by construction) applied to the
  executable face.
* Decidability lands as premise-carrying named `def`s
  (`decideJudgment`, `decideHolds`), never `instance`s: the premises
  are per-theory semantic facts instance resolution cannot see.
* The interval checkers are stated per element domain (`U64`/`I64`
  concretely) — the tree's precedent (`encode_interval_order` and its
  U64 companion): an abstract order class would buy generality no
  third domain spends. The two-conjunct shape of `pointsDisjointB`
  and `coverRowB` (a u64 arm AND an i64 arm, each vacuously true on
  the other domain) keeps the checkers total with no typing premise —
  the same totalization move as `Value.points`.
* `orderMarkB`'s downward-closure clause enumerates `1..k` for each
  attained position `k` (`List.range'`) — executable and exact
  against `OrdinalGroup.closed`; the count is data-dependent, and
  cost is not this file's subject (law 3: abstract cost lives in
  `Oracle.lean`, measured cost in the docs).

/-- **The two-phase agreement, instance-premise-free.** Under the
merge premise and the ACCEPTANCE form of the hop-key rule
(`RankKeysDeclared` — a fact of the theory, not of the judged
instance), `judgeB` and `Txn.judge` render one verdict on EVERY row
instance, hop-key-violating instances included: an instance breaking
a declared rank-hop key convicts in the key phase on both sides (the
hop key is a declared functionality statement and the key phase
consumes no chain premise — `mem_keyViolationsB`), and a clean key
phase yields the semantic premise (`rankKeysHold_of_clean_keys`)
that the conditioned agreement (`judgeB_agrees`) spends. -/
