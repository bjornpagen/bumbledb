# Countermodels — the design scratchpad (PRD 02 onward, grows all campaign)

Anything refused or bounded gets its countermodel here, ported or
new — countermodel-first is a covenant law, and the scratchpad is
part of the spec.

## PRD 02 residents

* `empty_interval_vacuous` — over a RAW bounds pair, because the
  in-tree `Interval` cannot be empty: it carries `h : start < «end»`
  as a field, and that unrepresentability is the POINT. The raw shape
  is what the artifact's `empty_nat_interval_has_no_points` warned
  about: an empty point set satisfies ANY coverage obligation
  vacuously, so an engine that admitted raw bounds would let a fact
  denote nothing and every dependency judgment over it hold for free.
  `crate::Interval::new` returning `Option` (parse, don't validate)
  is the mechanism that keeps this countermodel outside the tree —
  in-tree, `Bumbledb.interval_nonempty` is a theorem.

* The str-order refusal — `StrId` is an opaque intern id with
  decidable equality ONLY. No `LT`/`LE`/`Ord` instance exists for the
  intern domain: an intern id is a per-database allocation accident,
  so an order on ids would order the interning history, not the
  values. This is a deliberate absence (a typing fact), machine-
  checked below with `#check_failure`: the instance searches FAIL,
  and the build breaks if anyone ever adds the instances.

## PRD 03 residents

* `bare_eq_not_unique` — the two-row countermodel (port): bare `==`
  (mutual containment) holds between a one-fact source and a two-fact
  target sharing one projected key value, while the target projection
  is NOT a key. Bare projected view equality is not unique
  correspondence; the key premises of `KeyBackedEquality` are load-
  bearing, which is why each `==` direction must independently pass
  `resolve_target_key` (the ==-reverse-key locks).

## PRD 04 residents

* `unsafe_rule_infinite` — the unsafe rule whose "denotation" is
  INFINITE: one head variable bound by no positive atom, one
  nonemptiness-gate atom, a one-fact instance — and the answer set
  contains one tuple per intern id, so no list can enumerate it.
  This is what `Safe` (positive range restriction) refuses, and why
  `antijoin_over_active_domain` carries `Safe` as a hypothesis:
  negation and projection are only meaningful over the active domain,
  never over the infinite complement. The validator's mechanisms:
  `NegatedVariableUnbound`, `ComparisonOnlyVariable`, and the
  find-side binding check.

## PRD 05 resident

* `sql_zero_row_from_no_binding` — the refused SQL reading of the
  empty global aggregate (the seed artifact's `sum [] = 0`): a model
  that ALWAYS emits one row manufactures, over a rule that derives
  nothing, an answer with NO deriving witness — an answer from no
  binding, which the engine-faithful `Query.aggAnswers` cannot
  express (it demands the witness; `Query.empty_global_no_answer`).
  The artifact-divergence note in `Query/Aggregates.lean` records
  why the engine's contract is the authority.

## PRD 04 resident (continued)

* `one_way_overhang` — the [0,10)/[0,20) overshoot (port): one-way
  coverage of a [0,10) source by a [0,20) target HOLDS (with the
  target vacuously pointwise-keyed — a disjoint cover), while exact
  partition FAILS at point 15, which the target covers outside the
  source's support. The tiling over-read's killer: coverage is
  support INCLUSION (`coverage_is_support_inclusion`), never
  equality; exact partition needs both directions
  (`exact_partition_iff`), which is exactly recipe 26's five-statement
  construction and its commit matrix's one-way-overhang-accepted row.

## PRD 06 resident

* `sweep_premise_load_bearing` — the sweep's REQUIRED premise
  countermodel: an unordered segment list that jointly covers its
  source window while the one-pass walk convicts — the false REJECT,
  the "wrong verdict without erroring". Two recorded boundaries: the
  false-ACCEPT direction is NOT constructible
  (`Exec.sweep_never_false_accepts` is premise-free), and violating
  `Disjoint` alone cannot produce a wrong verdict
  (`Exec.sweep_complete_of_ordered` spends only `Ordered`) — see the
  section note and `Exec/Sweep.lean`'s module doc.

## PRD 09 residents

* `per_op_judgment_wrong` — the FinalStateView seam's formal
  justification: a two-deletion transaction (parent and child of a
  containment) whose FINAL state holds, whose two op orders reach the
  SAME final state, and whose parent-first order transiently violates
  mid-sequence. A per-operation judge would reject one order of a
  valid transaction — which is why judgment reads one final state
  (`Txn.judge`'s signature; `Txn.final_state_judgment_order_free`)
  and why `judgment.rs::FinalStateView` is a type, not a discipline.

* `incremental_verdict_needs_holds` — the delta-restricted judgment's
  load-bearing premise (`Txn/DeltaRestriction.lean`): WITHOUT
  `holds(pre)`, the restricted verdict accepts a violating final
  state — a pre-existing key violation in an untouched binding
  survives an empty delta whose touched set is empty, so every
  restricted check passes vacuously while the final state does not
  hold. Inside the lifecycle the premise is free (`State.models`);
  outside it, this countermodel is exactly why `Db::verify_store`
  exists — the sweeper re-runs both judgment forms globally, owning
  the class no incremental check can see ("an incremental form wrong
  once, long ago, preserved by every commit since" —
  `docs/architecture/60-validation.md` § the store sweeper, the
  division of authority).

* `stale_but_sound` — the maintenance protocol's freshness gap: a
  committed state (it `holds` its theory) whose derived relation is
  SOUND (its containment backs every derived fact — vacuously, here)
  yet STALE: the parent fact's derived copy never landed. No
  dependency statement can demand catch-up, so freshness is not a
  property of any committed state — it is host discipline (the
  `write_from` witness loop), exactly
  `Txn.derived_soundness_vs_freshness`'s other half.

## PRD 07 resident

* `distinct_premise_load_bearing` — the unkeyed double-count: one
  positive occurrence whose bound fields cover NO key, two DISTINCT
  facts (same bound amount, different unbound payload) collapsing to
  ONE full binding, and a `Sum` that double-counts under seen-set
  elision — 200 where the distinct binding set sums 100. The
  bag-semantics accident `DistinctWitness` forecloses, made concrete:
  `Query.distinct_witness_licence`'s premise
  (`Query.BoundFieldsCoverKey`) cannot be dropped, which is why
  `provably_distinct` is the only mint of the witness and
  `AggregateSink::without_seen_set` demands it by value.

## PRD 08 residents

* `elimination_needs_containment` — dropping a containment-backed
  atom WITHOUT the containment premise changes answers: a two-atom
  rule in full `Query.ElimStep` shape (every syntactic elimination
  condition holds) over an instance where the source fact has no
  target witness — the survivor answers, the original does not. Why
  elimination consults the THEORY (`plan/ground.rs::removable` scans
  `schema.containments()`), never just the shapes: the shape conditions
  are checkable at prepare, the existence guarantee is the statement's
  alone.

* `latch_miss_not_static` — the latch's two constructors are not
  interchangeable: a rule empty at one instance through a selection
  miss (`Query.EmptyAt.selectionMiss` — the `PendingIntern` dictionary
  miss, `Ok(false)`) ANSWERS at another instance, so the miss verdict
  can never be promoted to the plan-level `Program::Empty` — which is
  exactly the design decision `api/prepared/bind.rs`'s latch encodes
  (the miss short-circuits one execution; only the fold's refutation
  deletes the rule).

## Spec-fidelity F3 residents (the FieldSet split locks)

* `split_permuted_some` / `split_two_intervals_none` /
  `split_all_scalar_none` — the shape locks of the set-canonical
  `Header.intervalSplit` (the F3 fix): a written-order reading gave
  `[interval, scalar]` the classical judgment where the engine
  deliberately canonicalizes on the field SET (`resolve_target_key`
  counts interval positions as a set; `key_permutation` bridges
  statement order to key order), and it gave `[interval, interval]`
  a pointwise reading with an interval inside the "scalar" prefix.
  The three concrete headers pin the corrected split: one interval
  field splits to `some` at ANY written position, two intervals and
  all-scalar split to `none`.

## Extension residents (cardinality windows, E3)

* `unit_window_two_children` — the `1..1` window refuted by one
  parent with two distinct children (the bare-`==` rows, reread):
  the upper bound is load-bearing, not decorative — a window is never
  just its floor (`window_floor_containment` is the floor's half).

* `disjunctive_window_not_literal_conjunction` — why E3's literal
  sets are FIRST-CLASS, not per-literal sugar: the `1..1` window over
  `payload ∈ {true, false}` accepts each one-child relation and
  rejects their union, while ANY conjunction of per-literal windows
  accepting both one-child relations accepts the union too
  (`selTrue_group_union` / `selFalse_group_union` — each literal's
  child group transfers whole). Counts over a union do not decompose;
  the admitted count-vectors of a union window are not a product set.

* `joined_window_blast` — the E1 shape (a window over a joined pair
  of atoms) has NO oracle-bounded enforcement plan, and the refusal
  is BY REPRESENTATION (the admission-calculus resident; the
  countermodel section below).

* `joined_window_form_uninhabitable` — the blast composed against
  the acceptance gate's type (`Admission.lean: AdmissibleForm`): the
  E1 shape at its own grouping discipline has NO oracle-plan field —
  two runs whose touched consultations agree while the judgment
  differs, so "prohibitively expensive" is a type error (the section
  at the end of this file).

## The Free Join wrong-cover resident (the plan formalism)

* `loose_cover_rebinds` — the paper's looser cover rule ("containing
  all new variables", Free Join §3.2), refuted on the triangle query:
  a plan the paper's definition accepts (`loose_plan_paper_valid`)
  and bumbledb's exactly-new-variables rule refuses
  (`loose_plan_not_valid`) whose loose execution REBINDS an
  already-bound variable from the cover's facts without re-checking
  the occurrence that bound it, emitting a tuple outside the rule's
  denotation. This is `docs/architecture/40-execution.md` § the
  paper's core — the audit-found deviation paragraph — mechanized;
  until now it was prose plus a Rust regression test. The valid-plan
  side is `Exec/Plan.lean: valid_plan_sound`.

/-! ## The str-order deliberate absence, machine-checked

`#check_failure` succeeds exactly when elaboration fails: each line
below is a build-breaking guard that no order instance ever appears
on the intern domain (the `#guard_msgs (drop info)` wrapper only
silences the expected failure-to-synthesize report). Equality stays
decidable — that instance resolves. -/

One rule: `finds [v₀]`, one zero-binding gate atom, nothing else. The

/-! ## The sweep-premise countermodel (PRD 06)

The REQUIRED premise countermodel of `Exec/Sweep.lean`: the one-pass
coverage walk returns a WRONG VERDICT — without erroring — the moment
its `Ordered` premise is violated. The claims `[5, 9), [1, 5)` (start
order broken) jointly cover the source window `[1, 9)`, yet the walk
opens its frontier at 1, meets start 5 first, reads a gap, and
convicts: a FALSE REJECT.

Two recorded boundaries of the countermodel (the design findings of
PRD 06, `Exec/Sweep.lean` module doc):

* **The false-ACCEPT direction is NOT constructible.** The PRD asked
  for both directions "if constructible";
  `Exec.sweep_never_false_accepts` proves acceptance sound with NO
  premises at all — the frontier only ever advances across points a
  consumed segment holds — so a violated premise can only convict the
  innocent, never acquit the guilty. The checker's failure mode off
  its witness is spurious `CommitRejected`, never a silently accepted
  violation.
* **Violating `Disjoint` alone cannot produce a wrong verdict.**
  Completeness needs only `Ordered` (`Exec.sweep_complete_of_ordered`)
  — max-frontier tracking subsumes overlap, exactly the Rust module's
  claim. `Disjoint` licences the predecessor-seek entry below the
  fold's altitude (`judgment.rs::check_coverage`), and it is what the
  verifier's `pointwise_overlap_is_found_by_the_ordered_walk` fixture
  guards: the ordered walk is also how a broken disjointness premise
  is DETECTED, so the witness must stay minted at key acceptance.

This is the audit's "wrong verdict without erroring" made concrete —
the theorem-shaped reason `check_coverage` demands the
`DisjointDeterminantProof` token (order + disjointness minted at
pointwise-key acceptance) before entering the walk. -/

`Txn/DeltaRestriction.lean`'s restriction theorems all assume the

the two-row fixture (`rowTrue`/`rowFalse` — same key projection,
distinct facts) as a pre-instance under a one-key theory, judged by
the delta-restricted check against an EMPTY delta. The touched set is
empty, so every restricted check passes vacuously — and the final
state (the pre-state, unchanged) violates the key. -/

the FD reads classically. -/

/-- **The countermodel (the load-bearing premise).** WITHOUT
`holds(pre)`, the delta-restricted verdict accepts a violating final
state: every statement's restricted check passes over the violating
pre-instance and the empty delta (the touched determinant set is
empty), while the final state does not hold — the pre-existing
violation in an untouched binding survives, unjudged. Inside the
lifecycle the premise is free (`Txn.State.models`); outside it, this
is exactly why `Db::verify_store` exists: the sweeper re-runs both
judgment forms globally over the full committed state, owning the

/-! ## The unkeyed double-count countermodel (PRD 07)

The `DistinctWitness` premise, load-bearing. One positive occurrence
binds only the amount field; the relation carries two facts agreeing
there and differing at the UNBOUND payload field — so the bound
fields cover no key, the two distinct facts produce ONE full binding
(`amount ↦ 100`), the elided stream repeats the key, and a `Sum`
folded without the seen-set answers 200 where the distinct binding
set sums 100. Contrast the doc example "two postings of amount 100 to
one account are two distinct bindings (their fresh ids differ)" —
that holds when the fresh id IS bound; here it is not, and the
seen-set is what keeps the collapse honest. -/

counts over a union do not decompose. The `1..1` window over the
disjunctive selection `payload ∈ {true, false}` accepts each
one-child relation and rejects their union — while ANY conjunction of
per-literal windows that accepts both one-child relations must accept
the union too, because each literal's child group in the union is
exactly its group in one of the accepted relations. No conjunction of
per-literal windows expresses the disjunctive window. -/

/-- **The countermodel (E3).** The `1..1` window over the disjunctive
selection accepts each one-child relation and rejects their union —
while ANY pair of per-literal windows accepting both one-child
relations also accepts the union (each literal's group transfers
whole, `selTrue_group_union` / `selFalse_group_union`). A count over
a union is not any conjunction of per-literal counts: the admitted
count-vectors of a union window are not a product set. This is what
makes the literal set a first-class selection form rather than
lowering sugar. -/

/-! ## The recursion walls (Exec/Fixpoint)

Two countermodels fence the stratified fixpoint's two premises:

* **The odd loop** — `p ← ¬p`, negation through the predicate's own
  SCC. Not stratified (`odd_not_stratified`), and honestly so: the
  operator is NOT monotone (`odd_not_monotone`), its naive rounds
  oscillate (`odd_rounds_oscillate` — the empty table derives, the
  derived table underives), and NO table is a fixpoint
  (`odd_no_fixpoint`) — there is no consistent semantics to assign,
  which is why `Exec/Fixpoint.lean: stratumOp_mono` carries
  `StratifiedBy` as its premise rather than as a convention.

* **The successor operator** — value invention in a rule head,
  modeled at the OPERATOR level because it is unrepresentable in
  `PRule` syntax (heads are projected variables — the creation
  quarantine): `succOp X = {0} ∪ {m + 1 | m ∈ X}` is monotone
  (`succOp_monotone`) yet its naive chain ascends forever
  (`succ_chain_ascends`) and every prefixed point is infinite
  (`succ_prefixed_infinite` — no list enumerates it). Termination's
  premise (heads project BOUND variables, so candidates live on the
  finite active domain — `Exec/Fixpoint.lean: program_den_finite`)
  is load-bearing, exactly the chain-window fence
  (`docs/architecture/20-query-ir.md` § the chain-window fence). -/

/-! ## The join-blast countermodel (the admission calculus, E1)

The E1 shape — a window over a JOINED pair of atoms — has no
oracle-bounded enforcement plan, and the refusal is BY
REPRESENTATION, twice over, the strongest kind: `Statement`'s sides
are single `Atom`s (one `RelId` each — a joined side is unwritable),
and every `EnforcementPlan` evaluation answers from one oracle
(`Oracle.plan_answers_sound`) whose fact surface the per-form
conformance pins hold to ONE stored relation's denotation — the pins,
not the evaluation lemma alone, are what keep a join surface out
(the gate-type composition is `joined_window_form_uninhabitable`
below). This countermodel is the refusal's mathematical face: the
touched-group license every sanctioned plan spends — the
untouched-implies-unchanged lemmas of `Txn/DeltaRestriction.lean`
(`cardinality_untouched_group_eq` for the single-atom window) — is
FALSE for the joined shape. One inserted fact on one join side
changes the joined child set at parent groups NEITHER relation's
delta projects to at the grouping, one group per matching join
partner: deciding the shape costs consultations proportional to the
JOIN, not to the touched groups, which is exactly the blast radius
the acceptance gate's cost law refuses
(`docs/architecture/30-dependencies.md` § the acceptance gate). The
two-parent witness below is the seed: the delta projects to no
parent tag, the pre-state joined sets at both tags are empty, and
both gain a pair from the one insert. -/

/-! ## The Free Join wrong-cover countermodel (the plan formalism)

The paper's cover Definition ("containing all new variables") lets a
subatom that ALSO carries an already-bound variable be iterated. On
skewed data the executor then REBINDS the bound variable from the
cover's facts without re-checking the occurrence that bound it —
earlier nodes are never revisited. The triangle query below is the
`docs/architecture/40-execution.md` § the-paper's-core deviation
paragraph, mechanized: `R = {(1,2)}`, `S = {(3,4)}`, `T = {(1,4)}`;
the loose plan iterates `R` whole, then lets `S`'s subatom `(b, c)`
cover node 2 (whose one new variable is `c`), rebinding `b` from 2 to
3 and emitting `(1, 3, 4)` — but `R(1,3)` is not a fact, so the tuple
is outside the denotation. Bumbledb's exactly-new-variables rule
refuses the plan (`loose_plan_not_valid` — node 2 has no cover), and
every plan it accepts computes the denotation
(`Exec/Plan.lean: valid_plan_sound`). -/

/-! ## The E1 shape is UNINHABITABLE (the admission calculus, closed)

`joined_window_blast` above is the blast radius as data; this section
composes it against the acceptance gate's TYPE
(`Admission.lean: AdmissibleForm`): the E1 joined-window shape,
pinned at its own declared discipline — the joined judgment as the
`Judgment` field, the two joined relations as the consulted surfaces,
the parent-tag grouping as both surface projections — admits NO
`plan_decides` term. The argument is the blast's two-run reading: the
same delta over two pre-states (`blastPre` and the empty instance),
both holding the joined window, whose final states agree on EVERY
consultation at every delta-derived touched key (`touched_delta_
bounded` forces the keys; the only delta fact projects to `[keyVal]`,
and both parent-side consultations there are empty) — yet the joined
judgment is FALSE in one final state and TRUE in the other
(`joined_window_blast`'s two gained pairs). A verdict function of the
touched consultations would have to be both, so the field is empty:
"prohibitively expensive" is a type error, not an opinion.

Constructions local to this refutation: `listOracle` (a conforming
oracle over any listed fact set, trivial position order — the
countermodels' oracle builder; its filter decides tuple equality
through the eval machinery's `DecidableEq Value`,
`Query/Denotation.lean`), the open theory `admTheory` (every relation
open, so the denotation is the instance), and the two concrete oracle
families `blastOracle1`/`blastOracle2`.

The pins are the E1 shape's own declaration, not a loophole: a window
form groups parents by its grouping projection, and those are the
surfaces its plan may key — the same discipline `cardinalityForm`
(`Admission.lean`) inhabits successfully at one atom. Degenerate
groupings that scan a whole relation are refused by the gate's
acceptance rules on the docs side (`Admission.lean`'s recorded
narrowing), which is why the countermodel pins the grouping. -/
